## Iconic icons for WireframeSketcher

### Iconic aims to be the most forward-thinking icon set around based on its support of forward facing display/deployment methods. Icons should not just be clear and attractive, they should be easy and flexible to work with. [Learn more about Iconic](http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/)

### This is a fork that adjusts Iconic icons to work with [WireframeSketcher wireframing tool](http://wireframesketcher.com). Find the original version here: [https://github.com/somerandomdude/Iconic](https://github.com/somerandomdude/Iconic).

## Using Iconic

* SVG files compatible with WireframeSketcher can be found in the _vector wiresketch/_ folder

## Building Iconic

### Generating SVGs

There is a Ruby script that ajusts original SVG files. This script can be found at _scripts/vector wiresketch/adjust-vector-svg.rb_. It ensures that all icons are centered inside a square 32x32 viewport, and adjusts all icons to use black stroke and fill.
